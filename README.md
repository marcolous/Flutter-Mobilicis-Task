# Mobilicis Task - Flutter Internship Assignment

This project is a Flutter application developed as part of the internship assignment for **OruPhones**. The app includes features such as authentication, a home screen with product listings, and more. The goal of this project is to demonstrate Flutter development skills, state management, and API integration.

## Features

### 1. **Splash Screen**

- Checks if the user is authenticated.
- Navigates to the Home Screen or Confirm Name Screen based on the user's authentication status.
- Requests Firebase push notification permissions.

### 2. **Authentication Flow**

- Phone number-based OTP authentication.
- OTP verification screen.
- Confirm Name Screen for new users.

### 3. **Home Screen**

- Displays product cards with pagination.
- Allows users to like listings using heart icons.
- Shows dummy product cards after every 7th listing.
- Implements scrolling behavior similar to the OruPhones app.

### 4. **Bonus Features**

- Uses stacked state management for filters and sorting.
- Implements proper image caching and layout optimization.

## State Management

The project uses **Flutter Bloc** for state management, ensuring a clean and scalable architecture. Bloc was chosen for its ability to handle complex state transitions and maintain a clear separation between business logic and UI components.

---

## Architecture

The project follows a **clean architecture** approach, ensuring a structured and maintainable codebase:

- **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI components and Bloc logic.
- **Domain Layer**: Handles business logic and use cases.
- **Data Layer**: Manages API calls, local storage, and repositories.

This project relies on the following key dependencies:

- **flutter_bloc**: For state management.
- **dio**: For handling HTTP requests.
- **cached_network_image**: For caching and displaying network images.
- **shared_preferences**: For storing user authentication state locally.
